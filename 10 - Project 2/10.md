# Class 10 

Today we will continue to work on the exercises from last class. We will then take some time to do two code-alongs with animate.css and a FAQ. Then we will introduce the second project.

## Animate.css

animate.css is a fantastic little CSS library of css animations. They work by adding a class to an element, when that class is added, the animation plays.

We previously used animate.css in the cowbell exercise, but let's take some time to focus on how it works and how we can use it together with JavaScript.

Go ahead and open `animate.html`.

We will now step though how to 

1. Add an animation to an element
2. how to modify the time an element takes to animate
3. how to remove the class once its done

## FAQ to show/hide when the title is clicked

Open `faq.html` and let's work though a code-along to do the following:

1. When a title is clicked, it should show the text underneath it
2. How can we visually show that it is open? 
3. How can we make sure only one item is open at a time?
