# Project 2 

Project two will have a focus on using jQuery to interact with the users interface. What you choose to do for this project is up to you, here are a few requirements: 

## Requirements

These aren't 100% hard requirements, but to really push yourself, I would recommend trying to use most of the following:

1. Using the jQuery library
2. Interact with the HTML using events  (such as a click)
3. Take input from the user 
4. Update and edit HTML with jQuery
5. Nice looking HTML + CSS to go along with the jQuery
6. Have some sort of computed logic in it


## Ideas and Examples

- Modal box overlay
	+ Create a modal overlay like the one in `modal.html`. You should have an overlay div that you update the HTML of
	+ When someone clicks an artwork, the modal box opens and shows the entire description of the art work
	+ someone can click X or hit escape and the modal should close

- Invoicing system
	+ Create an online invoicing system
	+ At minimum it should:
	+ Be able to add as many items and assign a dollar value to each one
	+ every time a value is entered, the invoicing system tally the totals, including before and after tax
	+ Once the core functionality is finished, you may take it one of two ways:
		* Spend time on the interface styling it to look like a real invoice - perhaps adding slight animations
		* Spend time adding features
			*  Delete items
			*  add a client address spot
			*  Add purchase order input
			*  Multiple products (for example 10 computers at $1000 each)

- Flashcard game
	+ Create an game that will cycle through a list of questions and present three possible answers
	+ When a user answers one correctly, mark that question as solved
	+ display a counter of number of questions solved

- A break Timer that includes
	+ input for number of minutes break is
	+ labels for quick access breaks - "Lunch", "20 mins", "Morning Break (15)"
	+ Easily visible countdown timer
	+ Be back calculation ex "Be back at 10:20am"
	+ Yellow background 1 minute warning
	+ Red background when time is up
	+ Ability to "add a minute"
