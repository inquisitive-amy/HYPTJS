# Geolocation

Another really handy part of the browser is that it can give us the geolocation of a user.

Let's open up `geolocation.html`, again this needs to be done through a local server. 

Once open, view the console and try `navigator`. 

navigator is an object that holds many properties and methods for accessing a device's hardware - like the webcam. With this we can also get their current location. Go ahead and type `navigator.geolocation` - what do you see?

There are three methods - the one we are interested in is `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`.

### Geolocation Callback

getCurrentPosition() takes 1 argument - a function that will run when the Geo coords are accessed. Just like we have a function that runs when someone clicks a link, we have a function that runs when the user allows the website to access their geo coords.

With jQuery a click looks like this:

  $('a.thing').on('click',function(event){
    // do something with an event
    // this is the callback that get's called when someone clicks
  });

Same goes for this callback

  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
    // do something with the position
    // this is the callback that get's called when someone allows access
  });

Open `geolocation.html` and let's code one from scratch.

We also have two other methods - `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()` and `navigator.geolocation.clearWatch()` â€” These allow you to watch someone's position and have the callback run whenever their position changes - this is helpful for applications that need to be constantly updating the location of a mobile device.

### Exercise

1. Using jQuery, update the body to say something like this:

"You are located at latitude: latitude 43.2644387 and longitude -79.87574359999999 - this is about 71% accurate"

2. Use the watch position method to have the above update as well as display the speed.

Host it on your server and either run down the street to test it out, or try it on your way home!

## Google Maps

Next up we have Google Maps. Since it's such a large library, Google has created their own JavaScript library for working with the maps rather than using jQuery.

This makes it a little tough to get started, but it's definitely worth learning as custom maps increase the awesome-ness of a website.


### A simple Map 

Let's start off with a simple map, one that we can use as a basis for the rest of our maps.

Open `map-1.html` and we will code it together.

1. Find out the lat/lng of Toronto and set it to that
2. Change the default zoom. What is the max?

Along with Zoom and lat/lng we can there are tons of other options we can use listed at :

<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapOptions>

Try implement `draggable`

### Map Colours

Styled maps is a fairly new part of Google maps that can make your google map look totally custom.

The way Styled maps work is by creating an array of styles for the different parts of the maps. For example, what colour is the water? What colour are roads?

Open `map2-ANSWER.html` to take a look at how styled maps work.

Visit <http://snazzymaps.com/> for a collection of custom google maps styles. Grab one of them and play with the colours. Can you make red water and black land? 

### Map Markers

Adding a pin or a marker to a map is our next step.

To create a marker, we use the marker method and it takes two arguments:

1. A lat/lng for where the pin should be placed
2. the map the marker should be put on - this is important because it means you can have multiple maps per page.

A simple marker looks like this, we can put it in it's own function to we can easily call it later.

	var home = new google.maps.Marker({
	  position: new google.maps.LatLng(43.264009, -79.874947),
	  map: app.map // notice how we pass it the map we made earlier? This is how it knows which map to put the marker on
	});

### Custom Markers

Custom markers work much the same way except we pass it an `icon` property and the URL to the icon that we wish to have

Open `map3-ANSWER.html` for an example like this.

	var home = new google.maps.Marker({
	  position: new google.maps.LatLng(43.264009, -79.874947),
	  map: app.map, // notice how we pass it the map we made earlier? This is how it knows which map to put the marker on
	  icon : 'https://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/shapes/schools_maps.png'
	});

### Popup Boxes

Now that we have a marker - let's do something when you click it. Rather than use jQuery `.on('click')`, we use the Google maps `addEventListener()` method.

Let's continue to add this to our map. Answer is in `map3-ANSWER.html`

### Exercise

Create a Google map from scratch that does at least the following:

1. Load the map into the page
2. Apply a custom colour scheme
3. Use Geo Location to load the map where ever the user is located. 
4. Place a marker where ever the user is located
5. When someone clicks a marker, it should say "You are located at _________"
6. Place two more markers: One for the CN Tower and one for the Eaton Center. Each should have their own icon. When someone clicks each of those markers they should show pictures of the landmark. 

You can fake your geo coords by 1. opening dev tools, 2. turning on mobile emulation 3. clicking the TINY dots ![](http://wes.io/YU2O/content) 4. clicking the Sensors tab
